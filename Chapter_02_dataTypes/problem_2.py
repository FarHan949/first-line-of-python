#1.  write python program to add two numbers 
a = 69
b = 31
# print(a+b)

#2.  write python program to find remainder when number is divided by z 

a1 = 55
b1 = 105
# print(a1%b1)

#3.  Check the type of variable assigned USING INPUT () function in python

# x = input("enter the number : ")
# print(type(x))


#4.  Use compression operator to find out whether a given variable is greater than b or not 
# Take r = 34 , j = 80

# r = int(input("Enter the number 1 : "))
# j = int(input("Enter the number 2 : "))
# print("r is greater then j is :" ,  r>j)



# 5.  write python program to find out an average of tow numbers entered by the user

p = int(input("Please Enter the number  1:"))
q = int(input("Please Enter the number  2:"))
print("Average of your Entered  number is :",(p+q)/2)
